The [latest World Happiness Report] says that [prosperity is not the main reason for happiness]. If you [suffer real hardship], you [are unlikely to be happy], but [once your basic needs are met], [money and material things] become [less of a necessity]. Happiness [depends more on] [recognizing the things you have] and [appreciating them], [rather than] [getting more things]. Yes, money can buy you [the latest smartphone, tablet or fashion item], and you might [get a kick out of owning these material objects], but [this enjoyment] is [usually short-lived]. Remember [all those presents you got for your birthday] when [you were little]? You were [over the moon when you opened them], but [not for long]. A month later, they were [lying abandoned at the bottom of a drawer]. And have you forgotten [those delicious chocolates] that [made you feel really happy] [when you were eating them], but [ill after you'd] [finished them all]? [Take a closer look at the islands] and the reason [becomes clear]. [The Carterets] are [the victim of global warming]. [High tides] often [flood across the villages] and [wash away people's homes]. [Salt water from the sea] is [overflowing into vegetable gardens and destroying fruit trees]. It's [polluting the fresh water supply too]. Islanders [are struggling to survive on coconut milk and fish], and children [are suffering from malnutrition]. [The dying trees are home to mosquitoes] that [spread diseases, like malaria]. John [and his fellow islanders are] facing [great challenges], and they know that [life on the island is coming to an end].
