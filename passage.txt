The [distinctive features] of [Kun opera] are [spoken story-telling, singing and dancing], and [each character has their own particular style of movement on stage]. This [includes the way the character stands while speaking], and [the way they dance to show their inner spirit or essence]. Actors [may also be required to perform kung fu during their performance]. Given [the emphasis on how actors move], Kun operas [do not normally have complicated stage sets]. [Audiences] will [usually see only a few objects on stage] to [suggest where a scene is taking place]: [in a house, in a garden or in a dream]. With [its characteristic style], UNESCO [listed Kun opera among the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001].
