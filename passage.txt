The shark [closed fast on the boat] and [when he hit the fish] the old man saw [his mouth open] and [his strange eyes] and [his sharp teeth] as he [drove forward in] [the meat just above the tail]. The old man could hear [the noise of] [skin and flesh ripping] on the big fish when he [threw the fishing spear] [into the shark's head] at a place where [the line between his eyes] crossed with [the line that ran straight back from his nose]. [There were no such lines]. There was only [the heavy sharp blue head] and [the big eyes] and [the powerful teeth]. But [that was the location of the brain] and [the old man hit it]. He hit it with [his wet, bloody hands] [driving a good spear] [with all his strength]. He hit it [without hope but with determination and complete hatred]. Do [journalists always] write [true news stories]? They should. If [the story's not entirely true], then [it isn't news] - [it's fiction]. [This means] journalists need to [be good at] [checking up on facts] and [making sure their information is true]. If [our articles contain errors], [our readers won't trust us]. [We need to] [find good sources of information] and [collect all the facts]. Should [news stories] [appeal to the readers' emotions]? I think [you could say that]. [What is the use] of [reporting things that your readers don't care about]? However, [as journalists], [we need to] [write with care] and [tell news stories in an objective way]. [We also need to] [present the facts] [in a fair way that benefits our readers].
